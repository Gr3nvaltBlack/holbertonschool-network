## What happens when

"When you type www.google.com into your browser and press Enter, here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. Your browser first checks if it already has the IP address of www.google.com cached.
If so, it goes to step 4.

2. If not, it sends a DNS (Domain Name System) query to obtain the IP address of www.google.com.

3. Once the IP address is obtained, it establishes a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) connection
with the Google server.

4. If a firewall is in place, the request passes through it for verification.

5. The browser and the Google server negotiate a secure connection via HTTPS/SSL
(HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure/Secure Sockets Layer).

6. The request is directed to a load balancer, which selects the appropriate web server.

7. The web server processes the request and sends the necessary files.

8. If the page requires calculations or logic, the application server intervenes.

9. If data needs to be retrieved, the database server is consulted.

10. Finally, the data is returned to the browser, which displays the web page."
